cat("Hello intelligent life,  if you're reading this, please let us (the humans) know! 
    There are some things you should know about earth. 1. There are a lot of cool things here on earth, 
    like coffee. 2. This is the first time we have made contact with extraterrestial
    life so this is very exiciting for us! 
    3. Here's everything NASA wanted to tell you, apparently: https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/.
    I have some questions for you. 1. How long have you known about us and this planet? 2. Have you talked
    to other species from this planet? If so, which ones? 3. What is your planet like? 
    That's all from me, I don't know how you found this message, but cool!")
